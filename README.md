# notes
An application I use for "LiveJournal-ing" with Markdown and MathJax


## Running

I don't know if there any interest for anyone besides me to run this application. 
But just in case I have amnesia, the easist way to see what application does, is to run

```
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 slabko/notes
```
